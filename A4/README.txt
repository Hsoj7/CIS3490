To whomever is marking,

My program 2 works great. It searches the txt file for unique words
and increases frequency for non-unique words. It then sort the arrays
alphabetically. After, it will put the string into a binSearchTree
according to highest probability first.

I could not get my program 1 working. I was able to follow the
algorithm in the textbook to make the main and R tables, but could
not figure out how to insert into the tree. Since I am using two
separate arrays, one for the unique strings and the other for their
according frequencies, I could not recursively input the string into
the tree. I believe this would be possible using an array of structs
instead, but unfortunately ran out of time to do so. I'll take any
part marks for getting the tables working!
Running program 1 will output the top left and top right of my tables
to show they were set up. You can enter 1 to print the insert sequence
